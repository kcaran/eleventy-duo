<p>
Hand history files, like computer programs, are notoriously difficult to read.
Software developers use syntax coloring to highlight keywords and contrast
different sections of code.  I've developed a syntax definition file for the
<a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim editor</a> that colors both Poker Stars
and Full Tilt Poker hand history files.
</p>

<p>
Installation instructions can be found at the beginning of the file.
Installing the syntax file is fairly straightforward, especially for anyone
who has used Vim before.  Feel free to experiment with the colors, and
let me know if you come up with better.
